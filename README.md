#Lets Build a Game

##Part 1
In part 1 we will get the core structure of your code down, and get drawing to the screen as well as set up the game loop.

##Part 2
In part 2 we build on what we have so far. We get our player moving and able to fire!

##Part 3
In the final part, the return of the jedi for this game. We add some stars, an enemy ship, and a way to see if we hit the enemy.
